# A Note From Russ, One Guy From CrafterCMS :)
This game is a birthday card for the work of some of my childhood heroes. Roberta and Ken Williams, Scott Murphy, Mark Crowe (the two guys from Andromeda), Al Lowe, Josh Mandel, and many others who contributed to Sierra's adventure games.
These games had a major impact on my childhood. I do no doubt that this is true for many others as well. They taught us to solve problems, to laugh at ourselves, to get back up and keep trying when we failed, and to "Save early, Save often." For some, like myself, they inspired us to get into programming.

Happy 40th to King's Quest!  

Much Love
-Russ

# Let Them Eat Cake
Tomorrow, Graham must meet with King Edward for reasons unknown. This 'fan game' adventure takes place the night before Graham's quest commissioned by King Edward.
Graham "goes" on a bit of a silly quest that prepares him for the adventure that lies ahead in the following days.


# To Play the Game
This is the source code of the game. Don't venture further here unless you wish to encounter spoilers.

# Source Code
The game is free. I wrote the AGI scripts that 'power' the game. I borrowed, modified, and mashed up graphics and sounds.
The source files are now WinAGI GDS compatible and thus compile for DosBox and the AGILE engine.

## Version 1.0.0 - 1.7.1 
The source files were text and JSON files that can be edited by any tool. I've built plugins for CrafterCMS to edit graphic files and build the game.
The interpreter was initially written 8+ years ago by r1sc in TypeScript (GPL license) https://github.com/r1sc/agi.js. It could decode game graphic files and handle picture rendering, view rendering, and state machine mechanics. I've added to it the ability to handle input and dialogues, inventory, sounds, saving games, etc. I've also fixed bugs when I've had to. I was so excited to find someone had started this project. It seemed abandoned, so I picked it up. <3  

The game source, the tools I've created, and the engine are all open source. Download it. Extend it. Make it better and contribute back.
